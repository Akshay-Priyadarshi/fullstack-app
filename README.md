# Fullstack App

This repository contains a **full-stack** application, built with **Go** for the **API layer** and **React** for **Interactive layer**. This makes deployment and maintenance straightforward.

## Project Overview

This project integrates a **Go** backend with an **embedded React client**. The React client is bundled and served directly by the Go application, which simplifies deployment. The backend provides an API, which is handled through Goâ€™s Fiber package, while the React frontend handles the UI/UX.

-   **API**: Go (with Fiber)
-   **Client**: Go (with embedded React)

### Features

-   Serve both API and frontend from a single binary.
-   Integrated Swagger API documentation.
-   Development server with hot reload.
-   Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows).

## Installation

Ensure you have **Go** and **Node.js** installed on your machine. If you don't have them, you can follow the installation guides for Go and Node.js.

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

2. Install **Go** & **Node** dependencies:

    ```bash
    make deps
    ```

## Running the Application

### Development Mode

In development mode, the backend API and the frontend React app runs concurrently. The React app will be served on a development server, and the Go backend will handle API requests and serve the built React app.

1. Start the development environment:

    ```bash
    make dev
    ```

    This will:

    - Build the Go API and generate Swagger documentation.
    - Keep watching the react app for changes and keep building it in realtime.
    - Start the Go backend with hot reloading using `air`.

### Production Build

In production, a single executable is built, containing both the backend and the bundled React client.

1. Build for all platforms:

    ```bash
    make build
    ```

2. Run the generated binary:

    ```bash
    make run
    ```

This will start the API and serve the React app.

## Commands

### Install Dependencies
